    """Manage Challenge-Response Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) user accounts. CHAP users are one method of access control for iSCSI initiators. Each CHAP user has a CHAP
    password, sometimes called a CHAP secret. The CHAP passwords must match on the array and on the iSCSI initiator in order for the array to authenicate the initiator and allow
    it access. The CHAP user information must exist on both the array and the iSCSI initiator. Target authentication gives security only for the specific iSCSI target.

                     with other attributes. If any specified initiator is already associated with another CHAP user, it will be replaced by this CHAP user for future CHAP
                     authentication.
    creation_time  : Time when this CHAP user was created.
