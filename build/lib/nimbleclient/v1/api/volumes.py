                                    mapped usage exceeds warn_level, the array issues an alert. If this option is not specified, array default volume warn level setting is used to
                                    decide the warning level for this volume.

                                    On FC system, all volumes are exported under the FC Group Target. In create operation, the volume's target type will be set by this attribute.
                                    If not specified, it will be set as the group-setting. In clone operation, the clone's target type will inherit from the parent' setting.

                                    volumes, soft limit notification is set to initiators when the volume space usage crosses its volume_warn_level. Default is yes. The volume's
                                    space is provisioned immediately, but for advertising status, this change takes effect only for new connections to the volume. Initiators must
                                    disconnect and reconnect for the new setting to be take effect at the initiator level consistently.
