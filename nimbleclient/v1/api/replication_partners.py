class ReplicationPartner(Resource):
    """Manage replication partner. Replication partners let one storage array talk to another for replication purposes. The two arrays must be able to communicate over a network, and
    use ports 4213 and 4214. Replication partners have the same name as the remote group. Replication partners can be reciprocal, upstream (the source of replicas), or downstream
    (the receiver of replicas) partners.
